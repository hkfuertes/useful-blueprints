# My HASS Stuff

This repository contains Home Assistant blueprints I created for my own setup.

They exist because I needed specific behavior that wasn’t available out of the box, or because existing solutions didn’t quite fit how I use Home Assistant.

## Blueprints

The blueprints in this repo are mainly:
- Automation blueprints
- Designed around my real use in my own Home Assistant instance

They may assume:
- Specific device behaviors
- Certain Zigbee2MQTT actions or payloads
- A basic understanding of Home Assistant automations

## Usage

You’re free to use, modify, or adapt these blueprints.

Before using them:
- Read the description inside the blueprint
- Adjust entities and settings to match your setup
- Test carefully, I can't guarantee they'll cover every edge case

## Notes

I will maintain these blueprints as I use them. That is to say that if I don't need a blueprint anymore, I will probably not keep updating it.
